Kalki 2898 AD was initially scheduled to release on 9 May 2024, but was postponed due to unfinished post-production work. It was released worldwide on 27 June 2024 in standard, IMAX, 3D and 4DX formats. A commercial success, the ₹1,000 crore (US$120 million) Kalki has earned at the worldwide box office has made it the highest-grossing Indian film of 2024 and the 7th highest-grossing Indian film of all time among several other records for a Telugu and Indian film.
In 3102 BC, following the Kurukshetra War, Ashwatthama attempts to kill Uttarā's unborn child. For committing the act Krishna, the 8th reincarnation of Vishnu, curses him to roam the earth as an immortal and witness humanity's misery as a result of societal and moral deterioration in the Kali Yuga. His divine gem is also taken from his forehead, and his redemption is destined to occur only by protecting the mother of Kalki, Vishnu's 10th and final reincarnation, towards the end of Kali Yuga.[b]

In 2898 AD, 6,000 years after the events of the Kurukshetra War, the desertified city of Kasi stands as the last known city in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by Supreme Yaskin, a totalitarian god king. Yaskin rules from the Complex, an inverted-pyramid megastructure that tovers above the city. His authority is enforced by Commander Manas, Counsellor Bani, and Raiders who guard against threats, particularly the prophesied arrival of Kalki.

In this dystopian society, fertile female refugees in Kasi are forcibly taken to the Complex for Project K, an experiment aimed at producing a life-extending serum for the 200-year-old Yaskin through artificially inseminated foetuses. However, no women has survived the procedure. Raia, a young girl disguised as a boy, narrowly escapes conscription with the help of rebels from the hidden city of Shambhala.[c] Raia finds refuge in a cave where she encounters Ashwatthama. She unknowingly brings him his divine gem, Shivamani, which has been found by and passed on to her by the Shambhala rebels. Together, the duo set out to find the mother of Kalki.

Meanwhile, at the Complex, SUM-80, a Project K worker hiding her 150-day pregnancy, is outed and captured. Manas extracts a single drop of serum from her foetus before they are interrupted by Shambhala rebel. SUM-80 is rescued by Shambhala rebels and renames SUM-80 as Sumathi. En route to Shambhala, their convoy is ambushed by bounty hunters and Raiders. They fend them off.

Bhairava, a bounty hunter, remains in pursuit with his AI supercar, Bujji. Through his gem, Ashwatthama becomes aware of Kalki, Sumathi's unborn child, and intervenes. Despite Bhairava's efforts, Ashwatthama subdues him and the party reaches Shambhala, where the tree of life blooms in Kalki's presence. Bhairava makes a deal with Manas to capture Sumathi in exchange for his entry into the Complex.

Bhairava discovers Shambhala by disguising himself as Ashwatthama. He convinces Sumathi to flee Shambhala with him, but is intercepted by the real Ashwatthama. As they fight, Shambhala's leader, Mariam, attempts to take Sumathi away to safety. Manas and the Raiders track Bhairava to Shambhala and breach its defences. The Raiders overwhelm the Shambhalan army, and Mariam is killed by Manas. Manas then chains Ashwatthama, whose walking stick falls into the unconscious Bhairava's hand, where it get activated, and is revealed to be Karna's bow, the Vijaya Dhanush, revealing him to be a descendant or reincarnation of Karna, a warrior of the Kurukshetra War.

Empowered by Karna's bow, Bhairava undergoes a transformation into a superhuman and effortlessly defeats the Raiders and kills Manas. Bhairava reverts to his former self due to a distraction by Bujji and takes Sumathi away, as Awashthama looks on. Back at the Complex, Yaskin uses the serum drop extracted from Sumathi's foetus, partially gaining the power of unborn Kalki, and Vishnu. He picks up Arjuna's bow, Gandiva, and pledges to personally capture Sumathi and her child to reshape the world.
